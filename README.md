**Overview**
This Tableau dashboard provides an interactive overview of STAR reading and math scores for the 2024-2025 school year at Oakgrove/Firwood. It includes key insights and trends to help educators and administrators analyze student performance at a glance. 

**What is STAR?**
STAR is a standardized state test that students complete monthly. Students recieve a standardized score and a grade equivalent (GE) score. Grade Equivalent (GE) is a norm-referenced score that represents how a student’s test performance compares with other students nationally. For example, a fifth-grade student with a GE score of 7.6 performed as well as a typical seventh-grader who is 60% through the school year. This score doesn’t necessarily mean that the student is capable of reading seventh-grade material or doing seventh-grade math—it only indicates that the student’s reading or math skills are well above average for the fifth grade.
